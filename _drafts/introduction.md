This blog is a place for me to document my journey through cybersecurity from the beginning and provide insights to anyone who wants to read. In this post I just want to provide some background about myself and go through my expectations for this blog as a whole.

### My Background

Like many others within my age group I grew up with the internet, video games being beyond the old CRT monitors and technology enabling smart phones and consoles to become smaller and smaller.

As I grew up, I had a couple of people in my life that were very into computers. The first, being my brother, had every computer he ever owned, building computers in his room that he takes great pride in and loved 100% completing every game he touched. My father is very similar with his passion for computers and he opened my eyes to the ever changing world of system administration.

Now, I didn't realise how much I loved computers beyond playing Call of Duty 4 for hours everyday if not all day, like on the weekends and school breaks. In fact, I never realised this passion I had burning within until I entered the workforce.

Once I entered the workforce, I realised I had two different passions, computers and hospitality. 

#### What do I like about hospitality?

Look, I know it sounds crazy to like working in hospitality. I've liked the industry purely because I'm very good at getting a long with people and have always had a heavy focus on being very good at what I need to do in that industry, quickly. These two things are the most valuable skills to have in this hospitality, in my opinion.

Of course there are bad customers, there is in every industry however in my experience the good has always outweighed the bad.

#### What about computers?

What isn't there to like about computers?! They have revolutionised the world, so much so that we now carry a mini computer on our person every day. I think the best way to answer this is what **don't** I like about computers or rather how they're utilised.

Coming into cybersecurity, I have a number of years in other roles and industries that have no direct relation to cyberecurity or IT in general. I decided to pivot my career because my old path had become dry and unmotivating, plus the money is a nice incentive.

Now, enough about me. I think it's time to carry on.

### My vision

Coming into consulting, I've realised things move very quickly. I want to document my time in this industry so I can make sense of my journey, places I believe I need to improve and things I've done that I'm good at. If I'm able to help even one person through my experiences, I'd be forever greatful.

I'm not a wrtier by any means, so I'm sorry if any of this seems disjointed at all. Hopefully writing this blog will help my writing skills too!
